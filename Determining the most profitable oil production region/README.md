# Determining the Most Profitable Tariff for a Telecom Company





This project involves the analysis of two tariff plans, "Smart" and "Ultra," for a cellular communication operator named "Megaline." The goal is to determine which tariff plan generates more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget. The analysis will be conducted using a small sample of 500 customers' data from the year 2018. The project includes the following stages:
## Project Description
At the cellular communication operator "Megaline," there is a need to analyze two tariff plans: "Smart" and "Ultra." The commercial department aims to adjust the advertising budget based on which tariff plan generates more revenue. The analysis involves a preliminary examination of customer behavior using data from calls, messages, and internet usage for 500 customers in 2018. The main steps are:
- Examination of datasets and general information.
- Data preparation: converting data types, error correction, and feature engineering.
- Data analysis and visualization.
- Hypothesis testing to compare the average revenue of "Ultra" and "Smart" tariff users, and the revenue of users in Moscow vs. other regions.
- Conclusion and overall assessment of which tariff plan is more advantageous.
## Import necessary libraries
```
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Load datasets
```
calls = pd.read_csv('/datasets/calls.csv')
internet = pd.read_csv('/datasets/internet.csv')
messages = pd.read_csv('/datasets/messages.csv')
tariffs = pd.read_csv('/datasets/tariffs.csv')
users = pd.read_csv('/datasets/users.csv')
```

## Display the first few rows and info of each dataset
```
display(calls.head())
display(calls.info())

display(internet.head())
display(internet.info())

display(messages.head())
display(messages.info())

display(tariffs.head())
display(tariffs.info())

display(users.head())
display(users.info())
```

## Data Preparation
The data preparation involves converting date columns to datetime type, calculating aggregated values (e.g., call duration), and adding columns to calculate excess usage for each user.

## Data Analysis
The data analysis includes calculating and visualizing call duration, messages sent, and internet usage on both tariff plans. Hypothesis testing can be conducted to compare the average revenue of users on both tariffs and users from different regions.

## Conclusion
This project aims to determine which tariff plan, "Smart" or "Ultra," is more profitable for the telecom company. The analysis involves thorough examination and manipulation of datasets, as well as data visualization and hypothesis testing to draw meaningful conclusions about the revenue generated by each tariff plan.
