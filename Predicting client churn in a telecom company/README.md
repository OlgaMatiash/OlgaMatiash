# Forecasting Client Churn in a Telecom Company

This project focuses on predicting client churn in a telecom company using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately forecast whether a customer will churn, providing the company with insights to take proactive measures and retain valuable customers.

## Project Overview

The main steps of the project are as follows:

1. **Data Collection**: The project utilizes a dataset from a telecom company that includes historical customer data, including features such as contract details, usage patterns, and customer demographics.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The dataset is explored to understand the distribution of features, identify patterns, and gain initial insights into potential factors influencing customer churn.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing steps involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. This ensures the data is suitable for training machine learning models.

4. **Feature Engineering**: Relevant features are selected, and new features are created to enhance the predictive power of the model. These features might include customer tenure, usage trends, and contract specifics.

5. **Model Selection**: Different machine learning algorithms are considered for the task of churn prediction. Models like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting are evaluated.

6. **Model Training and Evaluation**: The selected models are trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are performed to optimize model performance.

7. **Model Interpretation**: Feature importance analysis is conducted to understand which factors contribute the most to churn prediction. This can provide actionable insights for the telecom company to take preventive measures.

8. **Results and Conclusion**: The final model's performance on a holdout dataset is reported, along with a summary of findings and insights obtained from the analysis. Recommendations for reducing churn and improving customer retention may also be included.
