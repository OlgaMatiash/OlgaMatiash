# Toxic Comments Detection

This repository contains the code and resources for the Toxic Comments Detection project.

## Project Description

The Toxic Comments Detection project aims to develop a machine learning model that can identify toxic comments in online platforms. The project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify comments as either toxic or non-toxic.

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

- `Toxic Comments Detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the code:

- Python (version X.X.X)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: [pandas, scikit-learn, nltk]

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
 git clone https://github.com/OlgaMatiash/Yandex-Practicum-Projects.git
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Toxic Comments Detection.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE.
3. Execute the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
4. Modify the code and experiment with different approaches as needed.
