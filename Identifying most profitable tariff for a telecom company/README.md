# Determining the Most Profitable Tariff for a Telecom Company

## Project Description

At the cellular communication operator "Megaline," this project aims to analyze two tariff plans: "Smart" and "Ultra." The goal is to conduct a preliminary analysis of the tariffs using a small sample of 500 customers and determine which tariff plan generates more revenue. The analysis is performed based on customer behavior data, including call durations, messages sent, and internet traffic used in the year 2018.

The analysis is conducted in several stages:

1. **Examination of Datasets:** The provided datasets including call records, messages, internet usage, tariffs, and user information are loaded and reviewed.

2. **Data Preparation:** Data is cleaned, converted to appropriate types, and prepared for analysis. Columns for call duration, messages, and internet usage are calculated and grouped by user and month.

3. **Data Analysis:** Various analyses are performed to compare user behavior between "Smart" and "Ultra" tariffs. These include call duration analysis, message analysis, and internet usage analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The provided code demonstrates exploratory data analysis using Python's pandas library. It covers tasks like data loading, cleaning, type conversion, and grouping to perform subsequent analysis.

## Data Analysis

The project conducts in-depth data analysis for both "Smart" and "Ultra" tariffs. Various calculations and visualizations are performed to understand user behavior in terms of call duration, messages sent, and internet usage.

## Conclusion

Based on the analysis of user behavior, it is observed that users on the "Smart" tariff tend to generate more revenue compared to users on the "Ultra" tariff. The analysis includes detailed insights into call duration, message usage, and internet consumption for both tariffs.

## Usage

The provided code and analysis can serve as a guide for telecom companies looking to analyze customer behavior and optimize their tariff plans for profitability.
