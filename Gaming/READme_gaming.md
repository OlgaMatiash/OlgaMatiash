# Gaming Analysis Project - Read Me


## Project Repository

**GitHub Repository:** [Gaming Analysis Project](https://github.com/OlgaMatiash/Yandex-Practicum-Projects/blob/main/Gaming/Gaming_%20for%20Git_final.ipynb)

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that presents the analysis of a gaming dataset. The project aims to explore historical data related to computer games, including sales, user and expert ratings, genres, platforms, and more. The primary goal is to uncover patterns and insights that contribute to a game's success, ultimately helping with strategic decision-making and marketing planning for an online game store.

## Key Highlights

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

- The project begins with data cleaning and preparation, including converting column names to lowercase and handling data types.
- Notably, the "user_score" column initially poses challenges due to values like "tbd" (to be determined). The notebook demonstrates how to handle such cases effectively.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- The notebook conducts a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.
- It analyzes the number of games released each year, providing valuable trends in the gaming industry.
- The analysis delves into the sales performance of different gaming platforms over time, identifying top-performing platforms.

### Data Visualization

- The project employs various data visualization techniques, such as bar charts and line plots, to present findings visually.
- Visualizations help in understanding trends and patterns more intuitively, making complex data more accessible.

### Conclusion and Insights

- The Jupyter Notebook concludes by summarizing the project's main objectives and key findings.
- It emphasizes the importance of the analysis for strategic decision-making in the gaming industry.
